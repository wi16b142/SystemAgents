The Adapter is providing several communication channels to the Agents. The base sample supports these channels:
- TCP Service
- HTTP Service (Web Service)
- Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ)

If an Agent is sending data to one of these channels, the Adapter is forwarding this message to the Core Component by using a TCP service.
As you can see the logic of the Adapter is very simple.

			!!!!!To run the projects you have to start VS as Admin, otherwise communication would not work without further steps!!!!!
